# I had added some files to my list and here they are:
# comp list.vbs will generate a list of your computers on your domain.  you will have to change the data in the LDAP section
# on line 34 for your domain and ou's.  You can change where it saves the file and the file name if you want.
# Network Wait.vbs is a script to wait for the network to start, keeping people from opening stuff, or automatically open 
# an app or script when the network is active on the computer.
# DelSearchBar.vbs will delete the search bar in the Windows 10 desktop.  This is for what we call floor computers.
# let me know if these have been helpful, or if you have some problem to solve.
